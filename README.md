Summary of the GAN Model and Training Process
1. Introduction to GANs
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of two neural networks: the Generator and the Discriminator.
These networks are trained together in a way that the generator learns to produce realistic images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (produced by the generator).

3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
We used the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels. The data is normalized to the range [-1, 1] to improve the training process.

4. Model Architecture
Generator: The generator starts with a dense (fully connected) layer, followed by a series of layers that progressively upsample the input (latent space) to the desired image size. Each layer includes Leaky ReLU activation and Batch Normalization to stabilize the training.

Discriminator: The discriminator is a binary classifier that distinguishes between real and fake images. It uses a series of dense layers with Leaky ReLU activation to process the input image and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation to output a probability score.

4. Combined Model
The GAN combines the generator and discriminator. During training, the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating realistic images. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake images. The generator is trained to maximize the probability of the discriminator misclassifying the generated images as real.

5. Training Process
Discriminator Training: The discriminator is trained on a batch of real images from the dataset and a batch of fake images produced by the generator. The discriminator's weights are updated to correctly classify real and fake images.

Generator Training: The generator is trained to fool the discriminator. Noise is fed into the generator to produce fake images, which are then classified by the discriminator. The generator's weights are updated based on the discriminator's feedback, aiming to improve the realism of the generated images.

6. Evaluation and Image Generation
During training, images are periodically generated to visually evaluate the generator's progress. These images are saved to disk. The generator can produce new images by inputting random noise after the training is complete.
